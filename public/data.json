    "summary": "In our modern day, standard computers are undoubtedly advanced compared to what we could muster up a few decades ago. However, with how fast and diverse computers are now, it's hard to imagine anything that could be even better. Enter quantum computing. This field of science aims to use the laws of the universe to achieve incredible goals. So, what exactly is quantum computing, and how will it affect our world in the future? What Is Quantum Computing? Image Credit: IBM Research/Flickr Though the dynamics of quantum computing are still being studied today, it originally emerged in the 1980s by physicist Paul Benioff.",

Let's take a look at it.So what are quantum computers?Quantum computers are computers that use quantum bits, or qubits. They are different in many ways from classical computers, which use bits that are either 1 or 0. Qubits can be in multiple states simultaneously, which means they can do several calculations at once.This is why quantum computers are such a big deal. They have the potential to be much faster and more powerful than classical computers.",

Quantum computers are designed using the often counter-intuitive laws of quantum physics and can store and process exponentially more information than the tablets, smartphones, and supercomputers that power much of the modern world. \nBut quantum computers have a long way to go before being used in our everyday lives. According to McKinsey and Company, only about 2,000 to 5,000 quantum computers will likely be operational by 2030, and those capable of handling the most complex problems may not even exist until 2035 or later [1].",
